# Changes Summary - Casino Form Restructuring

## Date: 2025-09-17

## Problem Identified
The user reported data inconsistency between the frontend display and admin panel. The casino editing form structure didn't match the required fields, and the frontend was displaying incorrect information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Structure (Already Correct)
The `casino_info` table already had the correct structure with fields:
- **Table Section Fields**: company_info, established_year, licenses_safety, operating_countries, supported_currencies, supported_languages, game_types, payment_methods, mobile_apps, customer_support
- **Detail Section Fields**: why_choose, casino_features, licenses_safety_detail, operating_countries_detail, game_variety_detail, sports_betting_features, special_promotions, suitable_players

### 2. Frontend Casino Card Display (Updated)
**File**: `/home/user/webapp/src/pages/casinos.ts`
- Changed to display only three fields as requested:
  - Supported Languages (with language icon)
  - Supported Currencies (with money icon)
  - Payment Methods (with credit card icon)
- Removed previous fields: welcome_bonus, min_deposit

### 3. Main Query Update (Updated)
**File**: `/home/user/webapp/src/index.tsx`
- Updated the casino query to fetch correct fields from `casino_info` table:
  - `supported_languages`
  - `supported_currencies`
  - `payment_methods`

### 4. Admin Panel Casino Form (Restructured)
**Created New Files**:
- `/home/user/webapp/src/components/CasinoForm.js` - Standalone component with proper structure
- `/home/user/webapp/src/pages/admin_restructured.ts` - Restructured admin panel

**Form Structure**:
- **Tab 1: Table Data (表格資料)**
  - Basic info (casino name, operating company)
  - All table display fields with 3 language inputs each
  - Links and settings (URL slug, logo, website, affiliate link)

- **Tab 2: Detail Content (詳細內容)**
  - All detail fields with 3 language inputs each
  - Expandable content for casino detail pages

## API Endpoints to Update
The following endpoints need to be updated to properly handle the casino_info structure:
- `/api/casinos` (POST) - Create casino with casino_info
- `/api/casinos/:id` (PUT) - Update casino with casino_info
- `/api/admin/casino/:id/full` (GET) - Fetch full casino data with all language info

## Next Steps
1. Implement the API endpoint updates to handle the new form structure
2. Replace the current admin panel CasinoForm with the restructured version
3. Test data saving and retrieval
4. Verify frontend display shows correct fields

## Status
✅ Frontend display updated to show only: languages, currencies, payment methods
✅ Database structure already correct
✅ Form structure redesigned
⚠️ API endpoints need updating for proper data handling
⚠️ Admin panel needs integration of new form component
